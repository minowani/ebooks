# On Beginners Questions About Nibanna

* Is it eternal?
* Isn’t it boring?
* Is there anything after?
* etc.

While it is understandable to have them, often the questions are abstract, more wordplays than anything concrete, and/or often sheer invalid. And when not, the answer most likely doesn’t ease your mind. I would suggest to view Nibanna just as the stopping of greed, hatred & delusion. Period. Since nothing bad can come from that, what happens then shouldn’t be of any concern. No matter how you take it, the stopping of those three would be quite a beautiful achievement.  

And why not to go beyond that? Because as beginner it isn’t something you are even remotely familiar with, which means you can only accept it as belief. And belief comes with doubt. And doubt sides with delusion. And thus that would be rather counterproductive.

If you keep this in mind, you can inform yourself about Nibanna (I would almost say as some form of leisure) but at least you have something a little more concrete to fall back to. Which might perhaps be of some help to let go of the many (misplaced) worries about this matter.
