# A Marble Floor

Suppose someone is helping a friend cleaning his new house. A lot has been done already and only some floors are left to do. When his friend goes to the store he decides to start on the old hall, which has a nice looking marble floor.

After mopping the hall he takes a break. When his friend arrives and to his surprise starts to clean the part he just had done, he tells him that he had cleaned there already.

When his friend explains that the marble is actually white and that what he thought what the pattern was is in fact dirt, he might look at the floor differently. Especially when he sees that with the proper cleaning tools the ‘patterns’ do indeed come off. And now he understands better what to do right? When he didn't see the dirt as dirt, he saw no problem in stopping where he did.

It is the same with the mind really. In the Anguttara Nikaya we find these two sermons:

> AN1.51 Bhikkhus, the mind is effulgent, it is defiled by external defilement. The not learned ordinary man does not know this and he has no development of the mind.

> AN1.52 Bhikkhus, the mind is effulgent, when released from external defilement. The learned noble disciple knows this and there is development of mind to him.

So, in this way it is not a statement about the mind being beautiful as it is, perfect in its nature, that it only needs to be observed, or anything like that. A clean floor is still a floor. With a dirty floor it is about not seeing dirt as dirt, and thus lacking the knowledge, effort, skill, interest, etc., to attain to the job of removing the dirt.
