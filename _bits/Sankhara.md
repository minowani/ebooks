# Sankhara

*Saṅkhārā is often seen translated as (volitional) formations,  activities.*

It is certainly understandable, when not understood, how certain aspects of saṅkhārā got translated as saṅkhārā, but in doing so it also got a bit abstract and unclear.

Important here is to remember that all what is grasped on as me, this I am, etc., which do not fall into the other four categories of grasping, fall into this one. And what do think, do you ***sense*** you to be *(volitional) formations* or *(volitional) activities*? 

Saṅkhārā translates as inclinations. If we say one is wired in such way or one is of such or so character (*thus inclined*) it relates to this category. And when something goes against ‘how you are wired’, inclined, *then* you‘ll notice how quickly this goes against your *sense of being*.

For a more in-depth explanation on why saṅkhārā is inclinations see ‘Knowing’.
