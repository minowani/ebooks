# Void

> *No core, yet real*  

There is a lot confusion about void, emptiness. It is often taken as nothing to be really existing, that everything is an illusion, even when this directly goes against the very first Noble Truth. And how can that be, right? So, lets look at another take on things.

The first Noble Truth states there is suffering; suffering is real. And what is suffering? In short our attachment to matter, feelings, perceptions, inclinations and conscious (Pancupadanakkhandha), which means we take these things to be (part of) me, myself. Or that this 'me' is in them. Basically we are hijacking these things, forcing the conceit 'I am' ([Mana](/Mana)) upon them.  

Now matter seen as everlasting, not subject to change, does indeed not exist, but matter that is not permanent and subject to change, does. As is the same with the other four categories. In the sermons we can find these five **compared** to respectively foam, bubbles, illusions, weed, and magic; lets look at these comparisons first.

## At the beach

> Matter compared to foam.

Take a look at sand, it is matter. But you don't see this matter originating nor changing or dissolving. Perhaps you understand that grain of sand existing long before you and will still do so after you are gone (though not likely to stay at the same place). Water and air, for example, too are matter but for many, when they think of matter, a first thought might be about something more 'tangible'. Foam might look more tangible. And with foam we do see it coming to shore, staying there behind and dissolving. And not only that, but foam also consists of foam. Matter consists just of matter, there is nothing else found in there. Or take an onion for example. If you remove the outer layer you see another layer, which you can peel off till nothing else is found. If you peel an avocado you do find a core, so that is a little different, but that core is matter too. When you cut an onion you don't only find layers, you find fluid, smell etc. too, these things are also matter. So, matter is matter through and through. Thus how matter behaves (arises, changes, ceases) is through and through too. In this way it is void, void from anything else that is matter. When understood you don't have to make more of that; there is no 'holiness' in matter for example, nor feelings in matter, etc.

## A rainy day

> Feelings compared to bubbles.

Feelings are not tangible like matter. But they are just as real. When bubbles are popped they are gone (though if not dealt with they can stay intact for a while too). Feelings are just feelings, they too are void of anything else.

## A rainbow

> Perceptions compared to illusions.

Another translation had something to do with 'beam of light' which reminds me of a rainbow. There is no tangible arc 'hanging' there, you can search for its end (for that pot of gold) forever. It is not that it isn't real, but it is a perception. Another thing to think of are optical illusions. Two lines can be perceived as different in length while they are of equal size. The perception is real, but it too is only perception, not lasting forever and it can change by adopting your viewpoint/understanding.

## The garden

> Inclinations compared to weeds.

When not addressed, weeds can creep all over the place. Left, right, under or over things. They grow and grow, and grow to cover places you don't want to be covered. Its the same with inclinations, they go all over the place. And when not held in check we get covered, overwhelmed, by them. Weeds keep coming back, they constantly need to be dealt with until they are uprooted. Like the others, inclinations don't contain matter, or feelings, etc., they are void of anything else.

## Not out of *my* ear!

> Consciousness compared to magic.

In magic shows often things, not seldom coins, are appearing and disappearing (while normally these things wouldn't). The trick is very quickly done so you don't really see what is going on. But once you know how it works you are not enchanted by that magic anymore. You don't see the magician as magical, or the appearing and disappearing coin as special. You might think the magician is a good trickster. And conscious appears and disappears fast too. So it is here, then it is gone. Not understanding, we are enchanted, tricked, by it. But consciousness just does consciousness, there is no matter, feelings, perceptions or inclinations in there. It leeches on those things and quickly appears and disappears, void of anything else.

# The lesson

> Getting to the core of things.

Whether things got a core or not is not really what we are talking about. What we assume, believe, see, think, is that there is an 'I', 'me', 'soul' or 'self' in these things; something that is 'me' at its core. But here we are taught that things are empty, void, of 'self'. When we are told whether it is or isn't so, it is not that much helpful; it doesn’t make it wisdom, it remains 'book knowledge'.

The teachings are set up to **train** so we can understand for ourselves. With these five being all void, we know the necessary we need to know about them. Thus we can play with that. As an example, if we look at the characteristics of these comparisons we see that:

+ they arise, change-while-they-are and cease, all through and through (like foam).
+ they can be popped, dispelled (like bubbles).
+ through understanding, changing views, we come to look at them differently (like illusions).
+ to stop them entirely they must be uprooted (like weed).
+ when full understanding arises, there is no more getting tricked again (like a magic show).

Looking at it this way, we see it is a lesson, instruction, showing us a bit about how-and-what-to-do; in fact it is about Dependent-Co-Arising. Emptiness is the very condensed form of this **teaching instruction**. Don’t just admire the label on the medicine bottle; read the instruction and apply to threat the threat.
