# Rebirth and Reincarnation

We don’t need to consult many buddhist texts to read that, according to them, death is not the end of suffering. Were it so a knive would then already have been a far more easier tool.  

Rebirth and reincarnation don’t have that problem, but they share a sameness in the idea that a certain something is carried over (or remains) from one life to another and precisely that is the problem.

These wrong views are about not understanding dependent-co-arising.

By using rebirth or reincarnation, perhaps as argument against the view ‘there is no birth after death’, it is still misunderstanding which keeps getting fed. While rebirth and reincarnation views can be found outside buddhism, dependent-co-arising can not. And to call an apple an orange, just to indicate it is no banana, is really of no help at all. It is ‘birth again’ as in ‘birth is happening again’ (a new result) and not as ‘something being born again’. Rebirth and reincarnation just show ‘birth’ not being understood. 

*If not something is not carried over then why should I care?*

You are still accountable for your own actions; you inherit the results. What you feel about you now, about ‘this’ being the real deal, that very same will then too be the case. Your then present life will be taken up as being your present life. It is one thing to speculate about a future life, another to experience life as it is. Unless addressed, it stays this first hand experience.
