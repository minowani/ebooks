# Dripping Soap

In AN5.3.8 we find the following comparison:

> " ... he over flows and touches this body with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, up and above and from all sides and around not leaving any spot of the body untouched. Like a clever bather or his apprentice, putting some bathing powder in a bronze bowl and sprinkling water on it would mix it, until it is a smooth ball of moist, oily foam not dripping anything."

I have always been intrigued by the last part of "not dripping anything". Why would that matter? If you spread out joy and pleasantness through and through, all over, why would "not dripping anything" be a thing? Suppose you would paint a whole room, from top to bottom, ceiling, walls, floor everything; why would dripping (*dripping*, not making such a mess that it piles up, just dripping) on the floor matter?  And... how would you even drip joy?!

Today I washed my hands in a very tiny washing basin; the soap is on a shelf on another wall. So I wet my hands (closed the crane), picked up de soap, turned it in my hands a few times and was about to put it back when I noticed the soap water dripping. I turned the soap a few times more, which made this soap water a bit thicker, so it wouldn't drip when put back. Then I thought about this sermon. The not dripping is not about not splashing it everywhere, all around. It means it is to thin to work with; it can't be put in good use because it falls away. And it needs more of the same work first, to make it thicker, to be able to put it into good use.

Because of the "smooth ball of moist" part in the sermon, the instruction itself was not lost. *"Establish it"* or *"Establish it, else it is not workable"* do not differ in "what to do". And there are more sermons (for example AN9.4.4, where a wise cow establishes her forefeet well before raising her hind feet in an unknown rocky area) stating the same. Thus though it was not an issue, it was fun seeing it clearified.
