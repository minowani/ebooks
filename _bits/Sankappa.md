# Sankappa

*Sankappa is often translated as thought.*  

We got thoughts all over the path... it seems so vague. 

What we can read is that there a 3 wholesome (Nekkham­ma­sankappo, abyapa­da­sankappo, avihim­sa­sankappo) and 3 unwholesome ones (kamasankappo, byapadasankappo, vihimsasankappo), so at least it doesn't mean all thoughts.  

We can think about renunciation, good-will, harmlessness, but when we are *trying to be* harmless that is a little different.  

To me Sankappa just means attitude. And Samma Sankappa, Right Attitude, the sincere attitude of harmlessness, renunciation, and goodwill.
