# Sila

*Sila is often translated as virtue.*  

> 'A virtue is a trait, quality, that is deemed morally good..'  

Would you consider *right concentration* a virtue? Or *right effort*? And what about *right view* for instance? I do, yet those are not sila.  

And what about bad virtue?! ... a bad quality that is *'deemed morally good'*? That is strange right? Yet sila can be good or bad.  

To me sila simply means conduct.
