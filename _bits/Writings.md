**Knowing**

A step by step explanation of the Buddha's Dhamma.

> My first writing. This website was setup as ‘home’ for this ebooklet. Topics include Anatta, Anicca, Dukkha, Kamma, Namarupa, Paticcasamupadda, Sankhara, but in plain english.  
Any special pali characters are replaced for epub readability.

**Paticcasamuppada**

Some suttas translations on Paticcasamuppada, with my commentary.

> After ‘Knowing’ and some articles I thought it could perhaps be of some help to translate some of the suttas *to show* how the general interpretation (links, casualty, lifetime, rebirth/reincarnation) is not the way to have a take on things.
