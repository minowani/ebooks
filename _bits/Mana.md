# Mana

*Mana is translated as conceit.*  

In the sermons we can find there are ten bindings. The first three are cut with stream-entry, the next two weakened by once-returning, the first five with non-returning, and the remaining five on arahantship. Mana is one of those last fetters, so as long as we are not enlightened we have Mana, conceit.  

Conceit is 'excessive pride in oneself'. If we see someone acting selflessly, would we then say this person is acting with/because/out of conceit? That feels a bit weird right? So, how can we let this make sense?  

'I was', 'I saw', 'I did', 'I want', 'I said', 'I feel', 'I think', ... If someone would use these in several sentences within a short period of time, we could think that this person is really full of him/her self. We could say that he/she is '*making it about him/her self*', hence conceit.  

But suppose someone was asked a lot of questions like 'Where were you?', 'What did you see?', 'What did you do?' etc. Then answering them with 'I was', 'I saw', etc. wouldn't automatically mean this person must be full of him/her self, even when those sentences are used within a short moment of time. So, conceit is more about ‘*making it about you, while it is not about you*'.  

At stream-entry ‘not-self’ is understood. But still the 'sense of self' is left. This 'sense of self' is regarding things that are not-self (see Pancupadanakkhandha). So this is '*making it about self, while it is not about self*'. In this way it got the characteristics of conceit, hence conceit.  

Conceit, arrogance, pride, self-esteem and so on, are all manifestations of this 'nature of conceit'. The most subtile one is this 'sense of self'; it is the conceit 'I am' (asmimana).
