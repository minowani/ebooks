# Tree Types Of Dukkha

In the sermons (e.g. SN38.14, SN45.165, DN33) three types of suffering are named, but I have not seen them there explained. They are explained outside the sermons, but in so far I have seen them they led to weird implications. Let me then offer an alternative.

## 1. Dukkhadukkha

Dukkha due to *suffering* (dukkha). And what is suffering? Birth, aging and dying. This doesn’t mean one must feel sorrow, grief or have an unhappy life. One can be very happy and joyful in this life. The point is that when there is no security from them, sooner or later, grievous things will happen for sure. 

## 2. Sankharadukkha

Dukkha due to *inclinations* (sankhara, see ‘Knowing’). Sometimes people keep making bad decisions and suffer the consequences. It might seem as if they just can’t help themselves, *as if they are wired that way (inclined)*. They are more inclined to act out of their greed, hatred and delusion.

##  3. Viparinamadukkha



Dukkha due to *change for the worse* (viparinama). We might get robbed, our environment may have to deal with severe wether conditions, we might get sick, our countries might get into war, etc. All these sort of things, when run out of luck (so to speak) or in case of force majeure, fall under change-for-the-worse.

# Free From Suffering

Normally when suffering from a painful bodily or mental feeling both *and* a bodily *and* a mental feeling are felt. Which might give the impression of this inseparable blob of suffering. Even so, that is not what suffering is. Just like happiness is not defined by happy feelings (whatever happiness there is, that is the happiness), so is suffering not defined by painful feelings. An Arahant can still feel bodily feelings (feelings is a khandha) but without the suffering that comes from being attached to it. Or to any of the other khandhas for that matter.

Then for an Arahant there is no:

* Dukkhadukka; Birth, aging and dying has stopped; the deathless has been reached. 
* Sankharadukka; Unwholesome choices can’t be made since greed, hatred and delusion are uprooted; there is thus no such inclination.
* Viparinamadukkha; Since there is no appropriation, no regarding ‘things’ as ‘for me’, or ‘mine’ or as ‘happening to me’, etc. there is no suffering dependent on that.
