# On How Pleasant Feelings Are Suffering

> Pleasant feelings suffering?! They are pleasant!!

Of course pleasant feelings are pleasant, but that is not what it is about.  

The problem with pleasant feelings is that they come with *lust* attached. And it is this lust that gets fed and increases. Since pleasant feelings are not permanent, it means that at some point they will make room for either a painful or neutral feeling. But while that pleasant feeling might then be gone, that lustful nature is not.  

A painful feeling comes with *aversion* attached. It is this aversion that gets fed, this aversive nature now grows. And in order to end a painful feeling we seek to experience pleasant feelings again.  

This way we are unseeingly feeding both lust and aversion. Some say that by avoiding both extremes (pleasure and pain), by being indifferent, neutral, about them, we have a solution to this problem. But a neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling, and not understanding feelings in general, has got *ignorance* at its root. Thus with that ignorance gets fed and grows.  

These three roots (greed, hatred and delusion) lead to unwholesome actions and thus they will be causing more suffering for us in the long run, not less. It is when these roots are fully abandoned that suffering has totally ended.  

Looking at it this way we can see pleasant feelings are a bait. We bite but it will take us out of the water, on to the dry land where we will not be in our element. It leads to places where painful feelings will be more common, the norm; where pleasant feelings might not even be a reality anymore. But we don't see this danger, we don't see that it is a huge price to pay for this pleasantness which *can't even stay for that long anyway*. We don't see that the bait isn't worth it at all. We are, very crafty, being mislead.  

But that doesn't mean that we now have to do without pleasant feelings. Practising, training doesn't suddenly make us all now not to feel, but be wise about it. Don't just bait all nice feelings, look at their roots. Develop the three *wholesome roots* and take pleasure in them.  

It should not be hard to see that if you don't kill, steal, lie etc, that there is no stress for getting punished for not doing those things nor the stress from doing those things. And being free from that stress is already up lifting. To develop good conduct is already going against those three roots.  

Normally we are engaged in the sensuous world, we seek pleasure out of our senses. From the sermons we learn that there is a higher pleasure to be found, when we withdrawn from those sense experiences and abide in the first jhana. And yet a more greater joy, if we withdraw from that too and enter the second jhana. This goes on throughout the four jhanas and the higher attainments. So, we see that by this method of refining we get a greater pleasantness. Most refined is the stopping of feeling and perception, which is then the most exalted happiness; with the three unwholesome roots being totally polished away.  

This way we understand that there are pleasant feelings which are *more* pleasant than what the baits can offer. The baits are like a very badly done imitation. But most don't have that kind of experience (nor train to get it) and coupled with not seeing the danger of ordinary feelings, they settle for the bait. Sadly enough, in the long run, leading to places with *less and less* pleasant feelings instead of more and more.  

So feelings are suffering because normally they *lead* to suffering, and it is suffering that leads to suffering; not not-suffering.
