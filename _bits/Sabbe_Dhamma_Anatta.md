# Sabbe Dhamma Anatta

>*Sabbe sankhara anicca*  
*Sabbe sankhara dukkha*  
*Sabbe dhamma anatta*  

A common interpretation is that since the third line talks about dhamma instead of sankhara it means both the sankhara and the asankhara. Nibanna is understood as asankhara and is thus included. But is this a valid inference?

A stream-enterer has understood anatta, then the last line is clear. Till then anatta is misunderstood (idem the others). To come to understand anatta we need to train. And what is there to train? In this context we can look at SN22.15 where is said that the five khandhas are impermanent (anicca). And what is impermanent is suffering (dukkha). What is suffering is not-self (anatta) and should be seen with wisdom as it really is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self (atta)’. Which leads to getting fed up, and with being fed up comes dispassion. Through dispassion liberation and with liberated there is that knowledge.

That the khandhas are impermanent is here a given, a statement; it is not explained. In order to understand we need to learn to see for ourselves how it is that they are so, which requires thoroughly grasping their nature. When f.i. we understand the nature of matter, we can even say something about matter which we have never ever encountered before. To look at that nature we need to look for, investigate, a more general level. What do all manifestations of matter have in common? That what it is, is then its characteristics; all matter behave accordingly. When wood is understood then to that extend all wooding *things* are understood. Likewise, when (the nature of) sankhara is understood (impermanence) then all dhammas (things and even the nature of things) are understood (as not-self). And that is what those three lines say. In this way they can be seen as a very compact instruction.

*But would that rule out nibanna?*

By implying nibanna as being included, it must also imply impermanence (anatta is seen *because* impermanence is seen) and with impermanence suffering, which simply can’t be. The line 'sabbe dhamma anatta' does here not justify making such (atta or anatta) claims about asankhara at all.
