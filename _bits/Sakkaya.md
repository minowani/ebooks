# Sakkaya



*Dictionary: the existing body.* 

Beings; there are humans, ants, cats, etc. Normally we understand a being as a composition of body and mind. Hair, part of the body, falls in the matter-group and feelings in the mind’s. The Buddha’s Teaching is not trying to explain science or biology; it leads us to understand how suffering arises and ceases, for which another classification is more useful.

All matter (coarse or fine, internal or external, in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near) belongs to the matter-group. The desire and lust (chandarago) regarding it, is where is hold on to (u­pada­na). This ‘group of holding’ (u­pada­nak­khan­dha) is thus called the matter-group-of-holding. In a similar way the other groups are named. These are: the feeling-group-of-holding, the perception-group-of-holding, the inclinations[1]-group-of-holding and the consciousness-group-of-holding. Together these five are called the five-groups-of-holding (pancu­pada­nak­khan­dha), which can be recognize as a **living body**, **a being**.

Further it is craving, thirst, (tanha) that brings the continuation of a being. Craving for the desire and passion regarding Sensuous experiences, Being, and Non-being.  As long as craving is intact there is suffering luring around the corner. With the cessation of craving there is the cessation of suffering. But craving doesn’t stop by just wishing it, so there is this whole teaching in place to get to that point.

A being is thus defined by where attaching attaches to, where craving craves. Thus what defines a human being is where our attachments are the strongest to; the ‘human sensuous experiences’. What we engage in, how we act, we become. Becoming a becoming, being a being.

*Sakkaya: living body, a being, a creature*

**Note:** 

[1] All inclined derived parts belong to the inclinations-group e.g.: aiming, orchestrating, inclination, intention, will, volition, etc. For an explanation why sankhara is translated as inclinations see ‘Knowing’.

# Sakkayaditthi

*Dictionary: heresy of individuality.* 

When we say ‘a **person**’ it applies to humans. We identify a certain being with ‘person’. This identification is a view (ditthi) on a being (sakkaya). 

This view too is something we **hold** on to. Sakkayaditthi is a lower-fetter, it causes fuel for birth. When this specific holding is let go, there is no more birth in lower realms (animal, ghost, hell). A person who has accomplished this is called a sotapanna.

There are different things one can identify with: race, gender, activity, etc. You could identify yourself as a certain employee. But loosing this identity, doesn’t make you a sotapanna. Thus then this sakkayaditthi is about a particular kind of identification. It is is a fundamental one, the holding (**upadana**) of things as self (**atta**). One can regard: 
 
1. Matter in self, or a material self, or in self matter, or in matter self.
2. Feelings in self, or a feeling self, or in self feelings, or in feelings self.
3. Perceptions in self, or a perceiving self, or in self perceptions, or in perceptions self.
4. Inclinations in self, or an inclined self, or in self inclinations, or in inclinations self.
5. Consciousness in self, or a conscious self, or in self consciousness, or in consciousness self. 

Sakkayaditthi could be translated as ’the existing body view’ but that doesn’t seem so useful. Perhaps a translation by meaning, rather than by letter, could be more helpful. For example ‘self-view’ or ‘self-identification’. Another rendering, but more as a kind of genericization (like Aspirin for painkillers), could be ‘person’ (you regard you as this person).

It is said (MN64) that a baby doesn’t have any notion about sakkāya, let alone sakkayaditthi. Whether it can regards itself as such or not, a baby is of course still acting as a being. And while there is no sakkayaditthi yet, there is this underlying tendency to it (sakka­ya­dittha­nusayo).

*Sakkayaditthi: holding-self, self-view, self-identification, a person* 

# Attavadupadana

*Dictionary: grasping the theory of an (enduring) self or soul* 

When things are held (**upadana**) as self (**atta**) some conclude ‘thus then there must be a Self’. But then those things, which one would regard as being or relating to Self, wouldn’t fall away. If we hold on to matter as Self (etc.), we should then be able to say ‘let my body be such’, or ‘let my body not be such’. And while we can do that to some extent, we can’t prevent the body from getting sick, old, decaying and dying. Others might thus see logic in saying ‘there is no Self’. Yet in either case one must first have this *idea* (**vada**) about what this *’Self’* is. From the sermons we can learn that holding the view *’there is a Self*’ sides with the wrong view of eternalism and holding the view *’there is no Self’* sides with the wrong view of nihilism, which *both* are seen as **Holding on to an idea of Self**. Without fearing to either extreme (self exists, no self exists), we can truly, without speculation, say that matter, feelings, perception, inclinations and consciousness are not-self (anatta).

# Mana

*Dictionary: conceit*

Even with things being not-self (anatta) there is this **sense of ‘I am’**. We might have been throwing ‘Me’, ‘Self’, and ‘I’, all on one heap but in the Buddha’s Dhamma these are different things. ‘I am’ is a very subtile form of conceit (mana), because the things where we leech this ‘I am’ on are for sure not-self (they have their own agenda: they arise, stay-and-change, and cease). This conceit is a higher-fetter; it causes fuel for existence or birth. When cut there is no more birth, no more ageing, no more death; cessation of suffering.
