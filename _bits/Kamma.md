# Kamma

*Kamma is often translated as action.*  

Kamma has a (different) meaning outside the Buddha's Dhamma, and this now finds its way in.  

Kamma in our context *does* means action. And there are just these three ways in which we can do things: bodily, verbally and mentally. We can only do something just now right this moment and of course, what we do leads to results.  

Do yourself a favour and don't use 'kamma' but use 'action' instead. This way a miss use, a miss understanding, is more easily spotted (by and for yourself).
