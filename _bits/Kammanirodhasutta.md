“I shall point out, monks, new and old action, cessation of action, the way leading to cessation of action. So listen and pay attention thoroughly, I shall speak.

And which, monks, old action?

Eye, monks, is to be seen as old action, arranged, intended, to be felt.... Tongue, monks, is to be seen as old action, arranged, intended, to be felt.... Mind, monks, is to be seen as old action, arranged, intended, to be felt. This is called, monks, old action.

And which, monks, new action?

Now which, monks, action one does at present by body, speech, mind. This is called, monks, new action.

And which, monks, cessation of action?

Now who, monks, touches emancipation by cessation of body action, speech action, mind action. This is called, monks, cessation of action.

And which, monks, the way leading to cessation of action?

This very Noble Eightfold Path viz. Right View, Right Attitude, Right Speech, Right Doing, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Recollection, Right Concentration. This is called, monks, the way leading to cessation of action.

Thus now, monks, taught, by me, is old action, taught is new action, taught is cessation of action, taught is the way leading to cessation of action.

Now what, monks, should be done by a teacher for the welfare of disciples, with empathy, out of empathy, so is done by me for you. These, monks, are roots of trees, these are empty places. Contemplate, monks, don’t be negligent, don’t become remorseful afterwards. This is our instruction to you.”
