# Dhatu

*Dhatu is often translated as element.*  

Element seems to be a proper translation. However it can be seen in a limited way, as chemical element or organic substance. While when I say ’there is an element of danger to it’ it is immediately understood differently. And there are those like the beautiful, sensual, ill-will, harming (e.g. AN6.111).

To avoid confusion I frequently use 'aspect' instead.
